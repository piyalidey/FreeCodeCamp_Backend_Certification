Timestamp Microservice

** Objective: 
Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to 
this: https://timestamp-ms.herokuapp.com/ and deploy it to Heroku.


** Here are the specific user stories you should implement for this project:

## I can pass a string as a parameter, and it will check to see whether that 
string contains either a unix timestamp or a natural language date (example: 
January 1, 2016).

## If it does, it returns both the Unix timestamp and the natural language form
of that date.

## If it does not contain a date or Unix timestamp, it returns null for those 
properties.
